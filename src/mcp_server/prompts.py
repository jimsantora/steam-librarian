## Overview
This tool uses multi-step preference gathering to understand exactly what you want.

## Elicitation Flow
1. You specify an initial genre (e.g., "RPG")
2. Tool asks about sub-preferences (e.g., single vs multiplayer)
3. Tool asks about time commitment preferences
4. Tool asks about difficulty preferences
5. Returns personalized recommendations

## Example Session
```
User: find_games_with_preferences(initial_genre="RPG")
Tool: "Do you prefer single-player story-driven RPGs or multiplayer RPGs?"
User: "Single-player with good story"
Tool: "Do you prefer shorter experiences (20-40 hours) or epic adventures (60+ hours)?"
User: "Shorter experiences"
Tool: "Challenge level preference: Casual, Moderate, or Hardcore?"
User: "Moderate"
Tool: [Returns 5-10 games matching all preferences]
```

## Tips
- Answer preferences honestly for best results
- You can skip questions by saying "no preference"
- The tool remembers preferences within the session""",

## Overview
Uses context-aware elicitation for refinement and clarification.

## Elicitation Flow
1. Analyzes initial context
2. May ask clarifying questions if context is ambiguous
3. Returns recommendations with explanation

## Example Session
```
User: recommend_games(context="mood:relaxing")
Tool: "For relaxing games, do you prefer: puzzle/strategy (mental relaxation) or exploration/building (creative relaxation)?"
User: "Creative relaxation"
Tool: [Returns building/crafting/exploration games]
```

## When Elicitation Happens
- **Family context**: Always asks for child's age if not provided
- **Ambiguous contexts**: Clarifies what you mean
- **Invalid contexts**: Helps you choose the right context
- **Missing parameters**: Asks for critical missing information

## Tips
- Provide context and parameters upfront to minimize questions
- Be specific with contexts like "mood:relaxing" vs just "relaxing"
- Use get_tool_help("recommend_games") to see all valid contexts""",

## What is Elicitation?
Elicitation is an interactive process where tools ask follow-up questions to better understand your preferences and provide more accurate recommendations.

## Tools with Elicitation
1. **find_games_with_preferences**: Multi-step preference gathering
2. **recommend_games**: Context-aware clarification
3. **find_family_games**: Age-appropriate content verification

## How It Works
1. You provide initial parameters
2. Tool analyzes and identifies ambiguities
3. Tool asks clarifying questions
4. You provide additional preferences
5. Tool returns personalized results

## Benefits
- More accurate recommendations
- Discovers preferences you might not have considered
- Reduces trial and error
- Saves time finding the right games

## Example Flow
```
User: recommend_games("family")
Tool: "I need some information to find the best family-friendly games:
       - Child's age (for rating appropriateness)
       - Number of players
       - Any content concerns?"
User: [Provides age: 8, players: 2, concerns: violence]
Tool: [Returns age-appropriate cooperative games without violence]
```

## Tips for Better Elicitation
- Be honest about your preferences
- Provide as much context upfront as possible
- You can always say "no preference" to skip questions
- Use get_tool_help() to understand what information tools need

Use elicitation_guide(tool_name="[specific_tool]") for detailed examples.""",
