Steam Librarian transforms your overwhelming Steam library into a curated collection. Just like a knowledgeable librarian who knows every book on the shelf, this AI assistant helps you rediscover forgotten gems, find the perfect game for your mood, and actually play those impulse purchases gathering digital dust.

**The problem we solve:** You have 500+ games but play the same 5. You spend 30 minutes browsing, then give up. You bought that bundle but forgot what's in it. Sound familiar?

**The solution:** An intelligent assistant that knows your library inside and out. Ask questions in plain English like "What should I play tonight?" or "Find me something like Portal" and get instant, personalized recommendations based on your actual gaming history, available time, and current mood.

# Features

### üéÆ What You Can Do

#### Natural Language Search
Ask questions like a human, get answers like a friend:
- "What should I play tonight?" ‚Üí Get personalized suggestions based on your mood
- "Find me something like Portal" ‚Üí Discover similar games you already own
- "Chill puzzle games for 30 minutes" ‚Üí Perfect matches for your available time
- "What co-op games do my friends have?" ‚Üí Find games to play together

#### Smart Recommendations
- **Mood-based**: Feeling stressed? Get relaxing games. Want a challenge? Find your next obsession.
- **Time-aware**: Only have 20 minutes? No problem. Weekend free? Here's your next 100-hour RPG.
- **Family-friendly**: Safe recommendations for kids with age-appropriate filtering
- **Hidden gems**: Rediscover those forgotten purchases and unplayed classics

#### Library Intelligence  
- See what you've been playing and what you've been ignoring
- Track your gaming patterns and preferences over time
- Compare libraries with friends to find common games
- Get insights into your gaming personality and habits

### üöÄ Two Ways to Connect

We offer two server versions to ensure compatibility with your AI assistant:

1. **Full-Featured Server (Port 8000)**: Complete MCP implementation with advanced AI features
2. **Compatibility Server (Port 8001)**: Simplified version for Claude Desktop/Code - works perfectly out of the box!

#### Why Two Servers? The "Oops All Tools!" Story
Originally, I built Steam Librarian to showcase the full power of MCP - resources, prompts, completions, elicitations, sampling - the works! It was a beautiful example of what MCP could do. Then reality hit: even Anthropic's own apps (Claude Desktop and Claude Code) only reliably support tools. Resources? Hit or miss. Completions? Nope. Elicitations? Not yet.

So, like Cap'n Crunch's "Oops! All Berries" (where a "manufacturing error" created a cereal with only the best part), I created the compatibility server - internally called "Oops All Tools!" - that strips away everything except what actually works. It's not a limitation; it's a feature! By reimplementing everything as tools (all ~20 of them), we get perfect compatibility while keeping all the functionality.

Choose based on your client:
- Using Claude Desktop or Claude Code? ‚Üí Use the Compatibility Server (port 8001)
- Using advanced MCP clients? ‚Üí Use the Full-Featured Server (port 8000)

python src/fetcher/steam_library_fetcher.py --friends
```

### 4. Start the Server

**For Claude Desktop/Code users (recommended):**
```bash
# Run the compatibility server on port 8001
python src/oops_all_tools/run_server.py
```

**For advanced MCP clients:**
```bash
# Run the full-featured server on port 8000
python src/mcp_server/run_server.py
```

### 5. Connect Your AI Assistant

Configure your MCP client to connect to:
- Compatibility Server: `http://localhost:8001/mcp`
- Full Server: `http://localhost:8000/mcp`

That's it! Start asking questions about your Steam library.

# Data Source

The server uses a sophisticated relational SQLite database (`steam_library.db`) with normalized data structure:
- **Games**: Comprehensive game metadata including ratings, reviews, genres, developers, publishers
- **User Profiles**: Complete Steam user information, levels, XP, location data, account details
- **User Games**: Per-user playtime and ownership data with recent activity tracking
- **Friends**: Social relationships and friend networks for compatibility analysis
- **Reviews**: Detailed review statistics and sentiment analysis

The database is automatically created and managed by the fetcher script. For detailed schema information, see [Database Schema Documentation](src/shared/README.md).

<br>

# Troubleshooting

### Common Issues & Quick Fixes

**"Connection refused" or server not responding**
- Make sure you started the server (step 4 in Quick Start)
- Check you're using the right port (8001 for compatibility, 8000 for full)
- Try: `curl http://localhost:8001/health` to test the connection

**"No games found" or empty responses**
- Did you run the fetcher? (`python src/fetcher/steam_library_fetcher.py`)
- Check your Steam profile is public (Settings ‚Üí Privacy ‚Üí Game Details: Public)
- Verify your `.env` file has the correct Steam ID and API key

**"User not found" errors**
- Set the `DEFAULT_USER` environment variable to your Steam ID
- Or ask your AI: "What users are available?" to see who's in the database

**Claude Desktop/Code not working**
- Use the compatibility server on port 8001 (not 8000)
- Run: `python src/oops_all_tools/run_server.py`
- Configure Claude to connect to `http://localhost:8001/mcp`

# Using the MCP Server

This MCP server uses the Model Context Protocol, which requires an MCP client to interact with it. The server exposes tools that can be called by MCP clients such as:

- Claude Desktop (with appropriate configuration)
- MCP-compatible AI assistants
- Custom MCP clients using the MCP SDK

The server runs on port 8000 by default with the following endpoints:
- `http://0.0.0.0:8000/mcp` - MCP protocol endpoint (HTTP transport with SSE)
- `http://0.0.0.0:8000/health` - Health check endpoint for monitoring

<br>

---

### Testing & Development

For developers and contributors:

```bash
# Quick checks before committing
make check                # Lint and format check

# Run tests
make test                 # Basic import test
make test-full           # Complete test suite

# Test specific servers
make test-tools          # Test compatibility server
make test-mcp-full       # Test full MCP server

# Development mode
DEBUG=true python src/oops_all_tools/run_server.py
```
